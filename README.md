# <Module-9-README-File-Maker>

  ## Description
  
  This project was created to save precious time when creating a README.md file by streamlining the process using node.js. The application asks questions and automatically properly formats your response resulting in a clean, concise file for your project. As a result the time saved by using this application can be better devoted to other more pressing matters. In creating this project I learned more about how easy and straightforward it is to create other files, and even projects using node.
